## Introduction
!!! Provide a brief overview of the project. Explain what the project does, its purpose, and any relevant background information.
This is a strength workout tracking application using SwiftUI and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It is aimed to solve the lack of customisability in current strength-training 
workout tracking applications by giving the user more ways to customise their workouts. It is designed to help users achieve more meticulous tracking of their strength training so that
they can accurately track their training regimens and progress.
