## Data Flow
The 'HomeView' view contains a 'Programs' NavigationLink with a destination of 'ProgramListView()'.
The 'ProgramListView' view declares an instance of the 'ProgramListViewModel' and iterates through the 'programs' in this instance. It calls the 'ProgramListRowView' view and passes through each 'program.name' and 'program.id'.
The 'ProgramListRowView' view declares a @State 'programID'. It contains a NavigationLink with a destination of 'ProgramView' that takes the '$programID' as an argument.
